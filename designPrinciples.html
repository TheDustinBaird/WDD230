                    <p>About two or three times a week my kids as for pizza instead of food for dinner. Sometimes I comply. 
                   I have noticed Little Ceasar's website in the past because of the sharp contrasts they employ.

                <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>

                <p>
                    I have been an online student at BYUi for nearly four years and can say that I have watched the website morph from 
                    something that was cumbersom and hard to navigate, into something that really is pleasing to view and easy to use. 
                    The white space is abundant but contrasted nicely with the school blue with blacks and grays used to highlight important areas.

                <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
                <p>
                    When I think of simplicity in design and streamlining choices, I always think of In-N-Out Burger.
                    They have intentionally kept their menu small over the years so that people can order quickly and 
                    get quality food quickly. They even have a secret menu you're not allowed to order from unless you
                    already know what's on it. I was pretty sure if I visited their website, I would find a similar style
                    of simplicity in design and choices.
